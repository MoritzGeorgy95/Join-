<h1>Join Kanban Board</h1>

Join was a group project built with a team of three people. I wrote all code associated to the contacts section and the add task section. This repo contains all the source code 
which is split up into the board-js section (contains all logic for the drag & drop kanban board) and the other respective files.

Join has two main functions:

<ol>
 <li> A drag & drop Kanban board, that allows users to create tasks, filter tasks, add team members to a task and move tasks around in a drag & drop area. </li>
 <li> A contacts section that allows users to create contacts and edit contact data.</li>
